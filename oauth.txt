What
---- 
OAuth 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user


Why
----

OAuth is used to provide secure and convenient delegated access to resources without requiring users to share their actual credentials

It allows applications to access user data or perform actions on their behalf, such as interacting with APIs, without needing the user's password or other sensitive information.
